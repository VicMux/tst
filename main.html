    newspaper for which Chitra was an occasional correspondent
    </em>
    <blockquote>
    <h1>Chitra Parayath</h1>
    <h3>Journalist, Community Worker</h3>
      <p>When she first heard of the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck on December 26, 44-
      year-old Chitra Parayath, a Lexington, Massachusetts based writer and 
      journalist, decided that the time was right to return to the Andaman 
      and Nicobar Islands, one of the most severely affected areas. Her return to her 
      childhood home, a gesture born of both commitment and nostalgia was, 
      however, to end in tragedy.</p>
      <p>Ms. Parayath reached Port Blair, the capital 
      of the Andaman Islands on April 17 to visit old friends, and collect 
      material for what she hoped would be a series of articles on the Islands. 
      &nbsp;She was overjoyed at being able to visit some of her old 
      childhood haunts and to partake of the Islands&#8217; life and culture that are 
      quite distinctive and different from mainland India. &nbsp;On April 
      18, as she was being driven from Rangat to Mayabandar, in Middle 
      Andaman, through some of the areas worst affected by the tsunami, the vehicle 
      appeared to lose control and go off the road. Ms. Parayath died 
      instantly. The car driver succumbed later to injuries. Two others were 
      injured.</p>
      <p>Chitra Parayath had a special relationship with the Andaman and 
      Nicobar Islands, a part of India where her parents spent much of their 
      working lives. After school in Port Blair, Ms. Parayath earned a 
      Bachelor of Engineering degree from Andhra University. After marriage 
      in 1983, she pursued her first love of writing and the media whenever 
      the opportunities arose. She liked to call herself a <dfn>sambhar</dfn> engineer, 
      referring both to the common South Indian dish that she prepared for a 
      most appreciative family, and to her own disinclination to pursue a 
      technology career. All along she wrote several times of the beautiful islands 
      and the unique culture of the place she grew up in.</p>
      <p>After moving to the US in 1994, Ms. Parayath was a contributor to several regional 
      and community publications, including India Abroad, Sulekha, India 
      Currents, Little India, and Lexington Minuteman. &nbsp;She was an 
      occasional host of community television programs, and media consultant for The 
      Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) organization in New England.</p>
      <p>Ms. Parayath was a founding-partner and editor of Lokvani.com, an e-magazine based 
      in the Boston area. &nbsp;She interviewed several well known 
      personalities who passed through the area, including Bollywood superstar 
      Aishwarya Rai, director Aparna Sen, singer Usha Uthup, and 
      cricketer Sunil Gavaskar. &nbsp;Her column &#8220;Bollywood 
      Baatein&#8221;, with news and gossip from the Indian film scene, was a 
      perennial favorite of the Lokvani.com audience, as were her humor-
      laden film and music reviews. In her media work Ms. Parayath was a 
      keen supporter of Indian-American artists, entrepreneurs, and achievers of 
      various stripes.</p>
      <p>
      Through her media involvement Ms. Parayath came to play 
      an active role in the growing Indian-American community of New 
      England. As Secretary of the India Association of Greater Boston (IAGB), she 
      worked diligently over the last few years in organizing the 
      Independence Day and Republic Day events in Boston, which have drawn 
      record crowds. &nbsp;She was actively associated with Saheli, the support group 
      for women from South Asia in the New England region. &nbsp;She 
      represented the Indian-American community press at Governor 
      Romney&#8217;s lunch for ethnic journalists in 2004 and 2005. 
      </p>
      <p>She leaves her husband, Vinod Muralidhar, two children -- Sidharth and Nivedita, 
      and a large, loving family in India and the US.</p>
      <p>As one of her 
      many friends noted in a tribute in Lokvani.com, &#8220;Quicksilver, warm, 
      witty, wonderful, unforgettable Chitra &#8230; May you finish 
      [writing] that novel in heaven, girlfriend.&#8221;
